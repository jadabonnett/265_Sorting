# 265_Sorting
P03_Sorting Project

This project consisted of me recrafting various common sorting algorithms, such as LinkedList and Quick Sort Median of 3 & 5.
With each of these then, I performed various testings of their speed and effiecency using my doubling test. The overall use of the project was to get experience with the different types of sorting algorithms and begin to see the differences between them.
